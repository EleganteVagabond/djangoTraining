# Django Training

In prepration for an interview with a company that used `Django` and `Python` in production, I set out to learn more following the [Django Project tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/)

To be honest I wasn't that excited about `Django`, perhaps because I'm not all that excited by `Python`. However, I'm an engineer, not an evangelist, so I enjoyed learning and trying out something new. 

*IMO* <sup>tm</sup> this is similar enough to `Ruby on Rails` for someone who is familiar iwth that to be easily able to **Grok** the concepts of `Django`.
